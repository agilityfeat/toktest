# toktest
Test repo for a TokBox demo

This demo allows you to have peer to peer video and file sharing
with another user using the platform provided by TokBox/OpenTok.

You can share as many files as you like, one at time, directly
with other users, without any servers.

You can try this demo [here](http://opentoktest.herokuapp.com).
